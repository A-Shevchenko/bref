# Caching

By default, the Bref bridge will move Laravel's storage and cache directories to `/tmp`. This is because all the filesystem except `/tmp` is read-only.

Note that the `/tmp` directory isn't shared across Lambda instances. If you Lambda function scales up, the cache will be empty in new instances (or after a deployment).

If you want the cache to be shared across all Lambda instances, for example if your application caches a lot of data or if you use it for locking mechanisms (like API rate limiting), you can instead use Redis or DynamoDB.

DynamoDB is the easiest to set up and is "pay per use". Redis is a bit more complex as it requires a VPC and managing instances, but offers slightly faster response times.

## DynamoDB Cache

To use DynamoDB as a cache store, set the following lines in `config/cache.php`:

```yml filename="config/cache.php" {8-11}
    'dynamodb' => [
        'driver' => 'dynamodb',
        'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
        'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
        'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
        'table' => env('DYNAMODB_CACHE_TABLE', 'cache'),
        'endpoint' => env('DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT'),
        'attributes' => [
            'key' => 'id',
            'expiration' => 'ttl',
        ]
    ],
```

Then follow [this section of the documentation](/docs/environment/storage.md#deploying-dynamodb-tables) to deploy your DynamoDB table using the Serverless Framework.
