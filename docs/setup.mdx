# Setup

To use Bref, you will need an AWS account and the `serverless` CLI. Let's get started:

<Steps>

    ### AWS account

    Bref deploys your applications to your AWS account. To create one, **go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click *Sign up***.

    AWS has a generous free tier that will usually allow you to deploy your first serverless applications for free.

    ### Serverless CLI

    Bref relies on the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) and AWS access keys to deploy applications. You will need to:

    - Install the `serverless` command ([more details here](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/)):

        ```bash
        npm install -g serverless
        ```

        <Callout type="info">Bref is compatible with Serverless Framework v3 (current version).</Callout>

    - [Create AWS access keys](/docs/setup/aws-keys.md)

    - Set up those keys by running:

        ```bash
        serverless config credentials --provider aws --key "key" --secret "secret"
        ```

        If you already use the `aws` CLI command, or if you want to use environment variables instead (for example for a shared server like a CI) you can [read the full guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#using-aws-access-keys).

</Steps>
