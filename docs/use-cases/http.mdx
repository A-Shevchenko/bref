# HTTP applications

## Binary requests and responses

By default API Gateway **does not support binary HTTP requests or responses** like
images, PDF, binary filesâ€¦ To achieve this, you need to enable the option for binary
media types in `serverless.yml` as well as define the `BREF_BINARY_RESPONSES` environment
variable:

```yaml
provider:
    # ...
    apiGateway:
        binaryMediaTypes:
            - '*/*'
    environment:
        BREF_BINARY_RESPONSES: '1'
```

This will make API Gateway support binary file uploads and downloads, and Bref will
automatically encode responses to base64 (which is what API Gateway now expects).

Be aware that the max upload and download size is 6MB. For larger files, use AWS S3. An example is available in [Serverless Visually Explained](https://serverless-visually-explained.com/).
