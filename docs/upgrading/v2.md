## Updating dependencies

### PHP 8 required

Bref 2.0 now requires PHP 8.0 or greater.

### Composer Dependencies

You should update the `bref/bref` dependency in your application's composer.json file:

```diff
-    "bref/bref": "^1.0",
+    "bref/bref": "^2.0",
```

Then run `composer update bref/bref --with-all-dependencies`.

### Bref CLI

The following commands of `vendor/bin/bref` have changed:

- `vendor/bin/bref cli` is replaced by the simpler `serverless bref:cli`.

  Read [the Console documentation](../runtimes/console.md#usage) to learn more. You will also find alternatives if you don't use the `serverless` CLI.

- `vendor/bin/bref local` is replaced by the simpler `serverless bref:local`.

  Read [the Local Development documentation](../function/local-development.md) to learn more. You will also find alternatives if you don't use the `serverless` CLI.

- `vendor/bin/bref layers` is replaced by the simpler `serverless layers`.

  Layer versions are also available at [runtimes.bref.sh](https://runtimes.bref.sh/) if you don't use the `serverless` CLI.

These changes allowed us to simplify the commands (automatically use the AWS region, credentials and stage from the `serverless` CLI). It also allowed us to remove the biggest `bref/bref` Composer dependencies and make the package much lighter.
